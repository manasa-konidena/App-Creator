<h1>App-Creator</h1>

<p>App Creator is a web application that helps non-developers create simple websites. I worked on this project for learning AngularJS through a course I took in my grad school. One of the best learning experiences I had was with this one under Prof. Jose Annunziato.</p> 

<h2>Environment to run the App</h2>

<ul>
	<li>NodeJS</li>
	<li>npm</li>
</ul>

<h2>Run the following commands to start creating apps!</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Install NodeJS for your operating syste</li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">NodeJS</a>
	<li>$ npm install</li>
</ul>

<p>Go to localhost://3100 on a browser of your preference and create away!</p>
<p>Once the app runs, the following notes can guide you</p>



<ul>
	<li>Login with the credentials - "manasa", "manasa" to see a sample of what can be done</li>
	<li>Register yourself or login with your Facebool ID to be an App Creator</li>
	<li>Several websites can be created and pages, widgets can be created for them.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Tech Stack used</h1>
<p>App creator has been developed using the all-the-range MEAN stack (Mongo, Express, AngularJS, NodeJS). The ease of running a server using Express is so light weight and is fascinating! With all the flexibility and novelty provided by MongoDB compared to RDBMS made this a fun project to work with.</p>
